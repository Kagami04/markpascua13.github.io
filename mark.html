<h1>MARK STORY</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Hi I'am Mark Hendrix Pascua from Calaca,Batangas. I'am a first year college in Batangas State University, 18 year old and here is my story<br><br>
As far as I can remember my story started when I was in grade 7. I was bullied for two year literally everyday. They called me insulting names and making fun in my appearance. It came to the point that I do not want to attend class because of fear. But one day I realized that I was being bullied because I am weak and skinny and on that day I began to strengthen myselt. I started doing push-ups, sit-ups, and other exercise that could make me strong. After two years my body change, it became bigger and stronger and that day I said to myself that I could fight them but I realized my parents would be sad and upset if I get into trouble. Then one day I saw the bullies playing basketball, while watching I felt something I can’t understand and on that day I want to learn basketball to beat the bullies without getting into trouble because in basketball you can be physical, hit them hard, block them, and cross them over. Then I started to train and learn how to play basketball. Afters years of training I improved and I was better than them. But I never had a chance to play with them and I don’t know why. And after one year my intentions in playing basketball have changed. I fell in love with the game, met so many friends because of the basketball and now it bacame my passion. I can really say that basketball changed my life. And until now I am still chasing for a better version of myself in playing basketball and even as a brother, a child, a friend, and a child of God.<br><br>
Lesson that I learned from my experience:<br>
Everything happens for a reason. Maybe you are experiencing something hard right now and maybe you are losing hope but I know God is just preparing us for something great that we can not imagine. Find your purpose. Trust the process. Keep improving.

<h3>BE THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF!</h3>
